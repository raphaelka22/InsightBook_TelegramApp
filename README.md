InsightBook_TelegramApp is a mini-app in Telegram that helps users manage their reading lists, discover key insights from books, and connect with like-minded people.  

#  About InsightBook  

## 🏆 Why was this product created?  
InsightBook was born out of a passion for books and self-development. The idea emerged from the need to track reading progress, extract key ideas, and connect with like-minded individuals to create future projects together.  
IBookClub is more than just an app—it's a community for entrepreneurs, economists, and investors who love books and knowledge.  

## 🎯 What problem does it solve?  
-  Helps users keep track of books they’ve read and plan to read.  
-  Provides key insights from books to enhance learning efficiency.  
-  Creates a community where people can discuss books and ideas.  

## ♟ Why is this app better than alternatives?  
Unlike traditional book-tracking apps, InsightBook focuses on:  
- Key takeaways and hidden meanings from books.  
- Interactive quizzes to reinforce learning.  
- A business-oriented community rather than just a reading tracker.
